### Meeting with Marta (27.04.2023)
- Drop Adress? Be Reasonable and rational, does it make sense?
- Check the data against the default status
- Why is the e.g. interest Rate highly correlated with loan status?
- Check the skewness if you replace missing values (Could change the distribution --> We don't want that)
- First deal with the outliers, then fill the missing values. (use median instead of mean)
- Drop the rows if there are missing values?
- Winsorize (95% / 5% or 1% / 99%), What does make sense?
- Stability over time? How does th mean /std change over the year? The NN should be able to capture it regardless
